# Ansible playbook for setting up a server with "The Littlest JupyterHub"

Note, the ansible playbook is used by:
  - https://github.com/ADACS-Australia/murano-jupyterhub a Murano package, which automatically creates a server on the Nectar cloud, runs the playbook, and creates the first admin user.
  - https://github.com/ADACS-Australia/openstack-tljh a packer builder to create an openstack image with the server already installed.


# Useful stuff (once the server is up)
## Creating the 1st admin user
To create the very first admin user, you must SSH into the machine, then register an admin username in the configuration
```
sudo tljh-config add-item auth.NativeAuthenticator.admin_users <admin-username>
sudo tljh-config reload
```
Back on the login page,
- click on `Signup!`
- use the `<admin-username>` you chose above + a password, click `Create User`
- click `Login!`, enter your username and password, and you should have immediate access without having to be authorized.

Note, make sure you register the username in the config ***before*** you signup.

## Authorizing a non-admin user
All users must sign up. Before they can login however, they must be *authorized* by an admin user (unless they have been previously declared as an admin user).
Admin users should navigate to `<jupyterhub-url>/hub/authorize` to authorize users.


## Installing packages
You can either SSH directly into the machine, or login as an admin and open a web terminal. Conda is installed as root, so most commands will require `sudo`. Remember to use `-E` with `sudo` to preserve the current environment variables (otherwise conda will fail).

To install packages into the base/main environment
```
sudo -E conda install <package(s)>
```

To install packages into another environment
```
sudo -E conda install -n <env> <package(s)>
```

To create a new environment with some packages
```
sudo -E conda create -n my_new_env python=3.8 numpy astropy ipykernel
```
Remember to make sure ipykernel is installed in each of the environments that you wish to be visible as a usable kernel.


## Sharing material with other users
Admin users can upload files to the `shared` directory to distribute material easily. This directory is visible to all users, but only writeable by admins.


## Changing your password
Users that are logged in the system can easily change their password by going to: `<jupyterhub-url>/hub/change-password`.


## Changing config options/limits
Examples
```
sudo tljh-config set limits.memory 24G
sudo tljh-config set limits.cpu 4
sudo tljh-config set auth.type nativeauthenticator.NativeAuthenticator
sudo tljh-config set auth.NativeAuthenticator.check_common_password False
sudo tljh-config set auth.NativeAuthenticator.minimum_password_length 20
sudo tljh-config reload
```
Remember to reload the configuration for changes to take effect.


## Quotas
To report the quota for all users
```
sudo repquota -avs
```

To set the quota for a particular user (e.g. `quotauser`)
```
sudo setquota -a -u quotauser 2G 2G 0 0
```

To apply the quota set on `user-1` to `user-2`
```
sudo edquota -p user-1 user-2
```

If you want to change the quota limit,
```
sudo tljh-config set quota <new-limit>
sudo tljh-config reload
sudo start-quota
```

The new quota will immediately be used for new users, and the `start-quota` script ensures that it is also applied to all existing jupyter users.

# Generic notes on setup/configuration/defaults

- User and group quotas (journaled) are enabled.
- In order to apply disk quotas to newly created users, a custom TLJH plugin/hook is installed that calls `setquota -a -u <user> <quota> <quota> 0 0`. Quota is read from the `tljh-config`.
- The default disk quota is a 2G hard limit (both on users and groups).
- Some `jupyterhub.service` configuration options are overridden in `/etc/systemd/system/jupyterhub.service.d/override.conf` to allow the service to access `/dev`. This is necessary for `setquota` to work, since it resolves to mount point `/` to `/dev/vda1`. It also sets an ExecStartPost to run a script after jupyterhub is up, to try and enable disk quotas automatically.
- The custom TLJH plugin/hook also modifies JupyterHub's `template_path` config option. It ensures that HTML elements defined by the Native Authenticator are being used (e.g. Authorize and Change Password tabs in the navigator).
- TLJH is installed with:
  - no default user(s)
  - the Native Authenticator
  - a minimum password length of 6
  - a 24GB memory limit,
  - 4 CPU limit, and
  - a timeout of 1hr for inactive notebooks, after which they are culled.
  - 2G disk quota per user
- Each of the above options are configurable.
- TLJH also comes installed with `nb_conda_kernels`, to allow conda environments to show up as available kernels to use. Each conda env you want to show up must have `ipykernel` installed.
- The naming scheme for conda envs/kernels is modified in `/usr/local/etc/jupyter/jupyter_config.json` to be cleaner.
- An additional conda env is installed (py3, latest python 3) with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, astropy, and ipykernel.
- A `shared` directory is added to every users' home directory. It is readable by everyone, and writable by users in the `jupyterhub-admins` group.
- Useful iPython style forward/reverse search history bindings are set for each user via .inputrc
